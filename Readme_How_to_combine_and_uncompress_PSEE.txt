    Tool: DisPredict2 (contains key component: PSEE)


1. Using 7zip combine the 18 pieces (each piece is ~48MiB) of files into one, name it "PSEE.zip"
2. Uncompress "PSEE.zip" (preferrably in Ubuntu Linux environment, as it is developed and tested there):  	
3. Read the Readme file within it and proceed accordingly.


Alternative approach:
 1. If available, download the compressed software as a single piece from http://cs.uno.edu/~tamjid/Software/PSEE/PSEE.zip
    The size of the file is ~841MiB.    
 2. Uncompress "PSEE.zip" (preferrably in Ubuntu Linux environment, as it is developed and tested there):		
 3. Read the "ReadMe" file, found inside the folder and then proceed accordingly.
